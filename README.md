## About the Project

In this study, we address the challenge of simulating multi-particle quantum tunneling, a phenomenon crucial to understanding various quantum mechanical systems but limited by the computational complexity of existing simulation methods. By developing an extension to the Benenti-Strini Method (2018), which originally facilitated quantum simulation of the single-particle Schr√∂dinger equation through trotterization of the complex Hamiltonian, we introduce an approach capable of simulating multi-particle systems.

We **simulated Nuclear Fusion** between two particles, governed by Quantum Tunneling.

The probabilities of occurrence of tunneling and positions of particles match the theoretically predicted results.

This method of simulation could be easily used to provide accurate insights into other **multi-particle** systems governed by **Quantum Tunneling**.

## Results

The plot describes the position probabilities of each particle as a grayscale plot where white corresponds to a certain probability of a particle in that distance interval, whereas black indicates 0 probability of the particle being within that distance interval. The distance intervals are plotted over the x-axis, while the time is plotted on the y-axis. It can be clearly seen that there are slight probabilities of either particle tunneling into the other.
